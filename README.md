# Remote Engine Blocker - SW2

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is the final assignment of the SW2 class at UFPE. It consists of developing a Remote Engine Blocker (REB) system.

## üîÄ Branch and Commit Standardization

There will be three types of branches:

- feat: creation of new features
- fix: bug fixes
- docs: documentation updates

For branch creation, the following pattern is established, using Jira card REB-12 as an example:

`(type)/(card-number)_task_description`

Examples of branch creation (with names in English):

```
feat/REB-12_update_readme

fix/REB-12_update_readme

docs/REB-12_update_readme
```

For commits (written in English), a similar approach will be used:
Examples:

`feat: short description of the task functionality`

`fix: short description of the task resolution`

`docs: short description of the task documentation added/updated`

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### System Architecture

This project consists of two programs:

- **REB**: The core engine blocker module.
- **AUX**: An auxiliary module that communicates with REB via Virtual CAN (Linux) and interfaces with the **GUI** through digital I/O. Aux contains Telematics (where you can interact through the buttons), Instrument Painel and Engine functionnality.

### üìã Prerequisites

This project is intended for Linux distributions. To install and run it, ensure you have the following dependencies:

```
apt-get install -y build-essential
apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

#### Optional (for generating Doxygen documentation):

```
apt-get install doxygen
apt-get install graphviz
```

### üîß Installation

Before executing the program, you need to activate the virtual CAN network in Linux. This setup is already automated in the Makefile. Use the following commands:

- **Create and activate `vcan0` interface:**
  ```
  make can
  ```
- **Deactivate `vcan0` interface:**
  ```
  make downcan
  ```
- **Remove `vcan0` interface:**
  ```
  make delcan
  ```

Once the virtual CAN network is set up, build the project by running:

```
make
```

To run the REB module, execute:

```
make reb
```

To run the AUX module(using another terminal), execute:

```
make aux
```

## DoxyFiles Reports

To generate Doxygen reports execute:
```
doxygen Doxyfile
```
To see reports, execute the docs/html/index.html
